#### Intro to JavaScript
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can use to achieve a goal, much like a recipe, handbook, or manual. 

To write a script, you first need to know the goal of the script, then the list of tasks it will take to complete that goal. A flowchart is a good method to use when designing scripts and related steps. 

It's important to learn to "think" like a computer, which is solving problems programmatically. 

#### Expressions and Operators
An expression results in a single value. These are typically either simply assigning a value to a variable, or using two or more values to return a single value. 

Operators allow for the creation of a single value from one or more values. There are assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and string operators to name a few. 

Arithmetic operators use numbers and perform mathematical calculations, using standard order of operations. 

String operators can join two strings together in what's called concatenation. Numbers and strings can also be used together. 

#### Functions
Functions allow for the grouping of single statements together to perform a specific task. This means that if there are parts of a script that repeat the same task, you can reuse the function rather than repeating the tasks in code. 

A function is declared by giving it a name, then writing the statements that it needs to compelete it's task using curly braces. All of the statements can then be executed by calling the function.
