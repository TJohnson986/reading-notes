- String - Can have letters and other characters, and is whatever is contained between single or double quotes

#### Reading Notes
The script runs based on its location within the HTML. It's a good practice to include the `<script>` or `<script src=>` towards the end of the HTML code. 

It is best to keep the JavaScript in its own file. 

JavaScript will not change the HTML, it works with the model of the web page that the browser has made. 

JavaScript is case sensitive!

Do use a variable, you must declare it. This simply means typing 'var variableName'. Then it must be assigned a value by typing 'variableName = 3.' The equal sign means 'to assign,' not equals. 

#### Variable Rules
1. Variable name must begin with a letter, $, or _. Cannot start with a number
1. Variable name can contain letters, numbers, $, or an _. Cannot use a - or a . in the name. 
1. Cannot use reserved keywords (google javascript keywords).
1. Variables are case sensitive. 
1. Use a name that describes what kind of info the variable stores. 
1. If the variable name is more than one word, use camelCase.
