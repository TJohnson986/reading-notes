#### Table of Contents

#### Terminology
- Document - The document object is the whole webpage. All browsers use it
- write() - method of the document object allows content to be written to the page. 
- Parameters - Information required by a method to work, written within parenthesis. 
- Statements - An individual instruction or step, should end with a semicolon. 

#### Reading Notes
The script runs based on its location within the HTML. It's a good practice to include the `<script>` or `<script src=>` towards the end of the HTML code. 

It is best to keep the JavaScript in its own file. 

JavaScript will not change the HTML, it works with the model of the web page that the browser has made.
