#### HTML Links
Links can be used to: 
- Link from one website to another
- Link from one page to another of the same site
- Link from one part of a web page to another of the same page
- Open a new browser window 
- Start an email program to address an email to someone

Links are created using `<a></a>` tags, and anything in between those tags are a clickable link called the link text. The href attribute is where the link goes.

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator - each page has it's own unique URL, starting with the site's domain name, then the path to the specific page. 

Absolute URLs link to a different website and include the full URL. 

Relative URLs are links within the same site which are just the local path. 

When building larger websites, its a good idea to organize pages into folders or directories. 

Email links use a mailto: attribute to open an email program and address an email to the specified user. 

To open a link in a new window, use target=_blank" after the URL.

To link to a different part of the same page, you can utilize HTML id attribute and HTML elements.
