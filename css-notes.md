The key to CSS is to see a box around each HTML element. CSS allows you to create rules that control the presentation of the individual box and what's inside the box. 

CSS associates rules with HTML elements. These rules consist of a selector, and a declaration. The selector is the HTML element that the rule will apply to, while the declaration is how the element should be styled. 

CSS rule precedence is determined by top to bottom order, meaning that if there were two identical selectors, the second would take precedence since it is read after the first one. Precedense is also determined by specificity, where specific selectors will take precedence over general ones. 

There are online tools to allow testing a page in multple browsers and versions across platforms.
