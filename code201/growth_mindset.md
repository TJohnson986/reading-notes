###### A little about me:
I can't say that I have much of an idea of what I am doing yet, but I'm definitely eager to continue learning. You can check out more of what I'm working on [here](https://tjohnson986.github.io/reading-notes/)

### Growth Mindset
It's incredibly important to maintain a growth mindset when learning something completely new, rather than approaching with a fixed mindset. 

A fixed mindset automatically assumes that skills and abilites are set in stone, and no level of effort or persistence will change those abilities. A growth mindset however is just the opposite, and maintains an open mind to challenges, obstacles, etc. to overcome any and all roadblocks that may appear to be in the way of your goal. 

### Notes to Self
- **There will be challenges**
  - Don't avoid them, embrace them. There's so much to learn from working through an issue. 
- **There will be obstacles**
  - Don't lose your momentum when your direction must change. Keep pushing
- **It will take loads of effort**
  - Don't see the road ahead as impassable. Your effort will get you anywhere
- **Others will criticize your decisions**
  - Learn from the mistakes you make and the corrections from others
- **You'll watch others exceed and succeed**
  - See this as proof that you can succeed too, rather than a comparison of skills or abilites.
