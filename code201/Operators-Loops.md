#### Operators
There are many different types of Operators in JavaScript, the first are **Comparison Operators.** These include: 
- == Is Equal to
- === Strict Equal to
- != Is not equal to
- !== strict not equal to
- \> greater than
- < less than
- \>= greater than or equal
- <= less than or equal

There are also **Logical Operators:**
- && Logical and - this tests more than one condition
- \|| Logical or - this tests at least one condition
- ! Logical Not - this takes a single Boolean value and inverts it to the opposite. 

#### Loops
Loops check a condition for a true or false. If true, the code block runs, if false it moves on. There are a few types of loops: 
- For loop - running code for a specific number of times
- While loop - code will continue to run as long as the condition is true
- Do while - will run statements at least once, even if condition is false
