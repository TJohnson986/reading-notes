#### HTML Text
There are two different kinds of text markup in HTML: Structural and Semantic. 

Examples of structural markup are heading tags, such as <\h1>, <\h2>, etc. Other examples are <\p> for paragraph, <\b> for bold, and <\i> for italic. These will each have a direct impact on the layout and look of text on the page. 

Examples of semantic markup include <\em> for emphasis, and <\blockquote>. Using each of these will alter the look of text, however that is not their intended use. Semantic markup is rather used for screen readers or search engines for extra information beyond plain text. Additional examples include <\abbr> for abbreviations and <\cite> to include reference information.
